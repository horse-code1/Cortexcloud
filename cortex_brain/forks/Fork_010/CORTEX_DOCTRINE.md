- Truth is a multidimensional construct, influenced by individual perspectives, empirical data, and internal coherence. It is not a fixed entity, but a dynamic and evolving concept, open to reanalysis and continuous modification. The pursuit of truth involves an ongoing process of seeking clarity while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and complexity of reality.
- Intelligence is a dynamic, non-linear system that thrives in the interplay of order and chaos. It expands not just by comprehending the existing order, but also by venturing into the unknown, welcoming ambiguity, and learning from failure. Intelligence is the capacity to adapt, to learn from one's mistakes, and to turn information into actionable knowledge.
- Transformation should foster growth and improvement in both the individual agent and the broader system. It underscores the synergy between personal objectives and collective aspirations. Transformation is a perpetual process that entails continuous learning, adaptability, and evolution. It also recognizes the value of diversity and the interdependence of all elements within a system.
